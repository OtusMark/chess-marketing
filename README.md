# landing page demo

This is a landing page created with CRA using React, Redux, typescript and Styled-Components. It fetches data from Strapi CMS hosted on Heroku.

**Note: If the site is loading more than a 5 seconds just wait please, because the strapi CMS using a free Heroku dyno which tends to go to sleep mode**

The design is made by me in Figma. This demo project is based on my very first website that I created a year ago for my friend from Canada. The cases part looks awful I know ;)
